# EasyOrphanage

We are trying to solve a problem related to adopting a child from orphanages. 
Generally, parents have to hop to different orphanages and find the one they want to adopt, but this is very much tedious and very time consuming process.

Why its important?
As from orphanage point of view, The reach of an orphanage is not that big, so that they can reach to any parent in a country due to which orphan children have to stay in orphanage for so long in hope that one day someone will adopt them.

From parent point of view, They have to find their loved one in many orphanages which takes a lot of time plus they can't interact with so many children at the same instant.




We are solving this with a decentralized network where the orphanage and parents can interact directly.

How?
We created DAPP where orphanages can list their children on the DAPP, users who are legitimate parents can view the children profile from different orphanages from all over the country. Parents can easily interact with the children profiles and find and adopt their loved one on the DAPP.
We are calling this DAPP as EasyOrphanage .
